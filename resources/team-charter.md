# Team Charter

## Instructions

_Answer the questions below and fill out the process sections with your team’s mechanisms to follow your answers. Remove the italicized examples text as you go._

_On real world software teams, you will often create a document like this via a process called [reteaming](https://www.agilealliance.org/resources/experience-reports/dynamic-reteaming-how-we-thrive-by-rebuilding-teams/). Having something that captures the goals and concerns of everyone on a team helps the team work more efficiently together._

## Purpose

Highly performing teams have the following qualities:

* Psychological safety
* Dependability
* Structure and clarity
* Meaning
* Impact

Your team’s charter captures the ways in which your team will commit to providing and cultivating these qualities. Provide the information requested in this charter, but feel free to modify the formatting to best suit your team’s needs and style.

The following guide might be helpful as you work through your teams charter:

### Psychological safety

* **How can we take risks on this team without feeling insecure or embarrassed?**
  _E.g., Be open to opinions that differ from your own, actively ask for opinions from each member of the team, do not interrupt each other, don’t place blame, all suggestions or questions are encouraged, listened to, considered equally, and never judged_
  
  We can take risks on this team without feeling insecure or embarrassed by making sure we are working in a branch separate from the main. Also, criticism to ideas should always be met with questions, not "no."
  
  Also, generally show respect for each other and their ideas. 
  
  We are a team of equals.
  
  No questions should be viewed as dumb. It's ok to say you don't understand.
  
  Also, everyone zones out. Ask if you zoned out. Don't just pretend like you followed along the whole time.
  
  We are all learning. Questions are a natural process and everyone is going at a different pace. 
  
  POMS are encouraged. Speak up if you want a pom break.

* **How do we address situations where any team member feels unsafe?**
  _E.g., communicate when there is a misunderstanding, don’t move forward until the situation is resolved, directly address and resolve negativity, give and receive feedback with a positive, strength-building mindset, if necessary, escalate to an instructor 
  
  When possible, address concerns before we get to the level of feeling unsafe.
  
  However, should something escalate, contact an instructor for technical disagreements, or for personal disagreements, put it to a vote. If equal, flip a coin.

### Dependability, Structure, Clarity

* **How can we count on each other to do high quality work on time?**
  _E.g., estimate task size, break down large tasks, call out tasks at risk early, ask each other for help, how to ensure timely code reviews, how to share knowledge, help each other hold accountability give frequent, scheduled updates_
  
  Big factor is clear communication of tasks and what a task involves. 
  
  Semi-regular check-ins to see how we are doing on a task every 90 minutes. 
  
  Consider the time a task will take while we are writing the tasks. Also, writing a "difficulty index" for each task will assist in making sure someone's "cerebral load" is light.
  
  Copy/paste when possible.

* **How do we address missed deadlines?**
  _E.g., acknowledge, but don’t punish slipped dates, figure out what went wrong, identify lessons for future_
  
  Missed deadlines aren't a big deal unless it's a surprise. 
  
  Set generous deadlines so we finish early more often than we finish late.

* **How can we make goals, roles, and execution plans on our team clear?**
  _E.g., where to track goals and when to review them, use definitive, quantifiable terminology, include clear background on why this goal is necessary, include “done” criteria for the goal (code is pushed with integration tests, document is reviewed, etc.)_
  
  This goes back to the tickets and tasks we set up in github. Making these clear and concise it going to keep our goals and execution clear.
  
  Make sure we communicate well in stand-ups. Don't skip those. For stand-ups, make sure bad news is sandwhiched so we never end on a negative. Psychology we cannot handle pain.


### Goals

* **Overall: What is our overall objective for the Learn & Be Curious unit?**
  _E.g., “Apply what we’ve learned throughout this program in a team project to prepare ourselves for internships and full-time SDE roles.”_
  
  Our overall objective for the Learn and Be Curious unit is to know a little more each day in the unit. Nothing more or less, but finishing our project would be cool, too. Also knowing more about endpoints would be great.


* **Performance: What do we want to prioritize in terms of what we achieve?**
  _What will be true when you have 'succeeded' on this project? E.g. enjoy ourselves, maintain our energy to the end, ensure all team members participate, create professional connections, exceed instructor expectations, efficiently pace the project so we’re not rushing at the end, etc._
  
  Getting our project in a place where it's "functional". This doesn't need to include every feature on our roadmap, but having something simple that works will be an accomplishment. (Minimal viable product)
  
  Being able to feel confident in knowing the process of how a program starts from scratch to building a final product. Taking the mystery our of the process just by doing that ourselves.
  
  Still liking our team members by the end.
  


* **Learning: What are the things that our team wants to learn?**
  _E.g., develop SDE knowledge, enhance leadership skills, master project planning, improve testing skills, etc_
  
  Endpoints.
  
  APIs and making them work.
  
  Frontend in general.
  
  Connecting front end to back end. And then making it work.
  
  Get better at forecasting the difficulty of tasks.


* **Task processes: What processes will our team follow to meet our goals, complete tasks, or to build team relationships?**
  _E.g., leadership, meeting procedures/length of meetings, expectations for meeting attendance and timeliness, other types of meetings (happy hours, lunch and learns)_
  
  Sticking to standups. 
  
  Plan for the future. Schedule a few days in advance. 
  
  Plan for cushion time.
  
  Make a point to be there for standups AND be ready to share before it begins. Taking notes throughout the day might help. Being late to everything else is fine with some notice.
  
  Lunch from 12-1.
